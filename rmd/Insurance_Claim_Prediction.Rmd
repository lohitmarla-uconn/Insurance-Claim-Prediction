##### Abstract
In the realm of insurance, the anticipation of claims plays a pivotal role in risk management and financial planning. This project delves into the challenge of predicting insurance claims, a task made intricate by a dataset characterized by its modest sample size and a slight imbalance between claimed and unclaimed instances. The objective is to surmount these obstacles and construct a robust predictive model capable of accurately classifying insurance claims. The project will navigate through methodologies to address imbalances, optimize feature extraction, and employ advanced predictive modeling techniques such as classification and regression trees, random forest, xgboost algorithms, and statistical models such as logit and probit. By tackling these complexities head-on, the study aims to contribute valuable insights to the field of insurance analytics, enabling more informed decision-making and risk assessment.
